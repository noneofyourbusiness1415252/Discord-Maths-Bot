# Umar's Discord Maths Bot

This is the code for a bot I made. It is being hosted on repl.it using [this tutorial](https://replit.com/talk/learn/Hosting-discordpy-bots-with-replit/11008).

## What the bot currently does

Currently, I have added commands to:

-   find primes, squares or cubes within 2 numbers
    calculate an expression using python operators or the `cmath` module
    find volume of many 3D shapes

## What is planned in future

I am trying to add the quiz from [Umar's Maths Stuff](https://github.com/noneofyourbusiness1415252/Maths-stuff) to this, but it will be a little harder to implement it into a discord bot.
