# Umar's Discord Maths Bot

This is the code for a bot I made. Currently, there is no way for me to host it,
so I am saving up for a Raspberry Pi 4 4GB, which costs Â£75.

## What the bot currently does

Currently, I have added commands to:

-   find primes, squares or cubes within 2 numbers
    calculate an expression using python operators or the `cmath` module
    find volume of many 3D shapes

## What is planned in future

I am trying to add the quiz from [Umar's Maths Stuff](https://github.com/noneofyourbusiness1415252/Maths-stuff) to this, but it will be a little harder to implement it into a discord bot.
